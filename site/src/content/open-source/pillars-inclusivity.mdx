Anyone with the capacity to contribute: can. We are proactive in welcoming a diverse contributor base for our code,
documentation, developer relations, education, and communication efforts. Bad actors will be met with a published governance model and enforced code of conduct. Our users deserve representation in our development communities, and we promote
varied perspectives and respectful debate.
